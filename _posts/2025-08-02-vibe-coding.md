    The Vibe Shooter game - a 2D top-down shooting game inspired by Vampire Survivors and other favorites.
</div>

I wanted to try how far vibe coding can go, so I tried making a 2D top-down shooting game that has the feel from my favorite games: Vampire Survivors, Overwatch, League of Legends, MapleStory, and more. 

The result is [here](https://vibe-shooter-six.vercel.app/) - keyboard and mouse are required.

I used Cursor with a Pro subscription but ran out of credits in a few hours. I also tried `gemini-cli`, but the free tier account only had a very limited number of tokens available.
