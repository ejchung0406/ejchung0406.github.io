Hello! Iâ€™m Euijun (_E - June_) Chung, a second-year Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech. My research focuses on GPU architecture, GPU security, and GPU simulations. 

I am a member of the [HPArch research group](https://sites.gatech.edu/hparch/), where I am advised by Dr. Hyesoon Kim. Before I joined Georgia Tech, I received my B.S. in [Electrical Engineering from KAIST](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/) in 2024.
